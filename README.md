# TheWalkingStyx

<p>
The Walking Styx is a 2D Survival Stealth Game, playing in the antique Greek era.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Titans themselves, in their aim to take over the world, caused a huge earthquake. This massive shake even reached the deep grounds of the underworld.<br>
It was so severe that it created rifts all over the underworld. Through these rifts the River of Souls, the Styx, leaked into the groundwater of the human world.<br>
<br>
With devastating consequences!<br> <br>

The naive Humans, not knowing their water is a baleful mix of souls and groundwater, drank and used it like everyday. <br>
But instead of stilling their thirst the water absorbed their souls.<br>
Now their soulless but still living bodies wander around. Driven by a poignant hunger to fill the gap their lost soul has left.

                                            But Beware of the Soulless! <br>
