# TheWalkingStyx

<p>
The Walking Styx is a 2D Survival Stealth Game, playing in the antique Greek era.<br>
</p>
<p>
The Titans themselves, in their aim to take over the world, caused a huge earthquake. This massive shake even reached the deep grounds of the Underworld.<br>
The shaking was so severe that it created rifts all over the underworld. Through these rifts the River of Souls, the Styx, leaked into the groundwater of the Human World.<br>

With devastating consequences!<br>  

The naive Humans, not knowing their water is a baleful mix with the Styx, drank and used it like everyday. <br>
But instead of stilling their thirst the water absorbed their souls.<br>
But their still living, soulless bodies still wander around. Driven by a poignant hunger to fill the gap their lost soul has left.
</p>
<p>
Now itÂ´s up to you! <br>
As one of the legendary Greek Heroes you have to save the world. <br>
Find the entrance to the underworld and close the rifts, which a causing this soul stealing dilemma. <br>
But Beware of the Soulless! <br>
They will attack you immediately but you can not harm them because deep down they are innocent Humans.<br>
